# My Personal Portfolio

## Description
For this project, I had to recreate my personal portfolio using Bootstrap. My personal portfolio will showcase all my future projects and websites, which will eventually help me in future interviews and job offers. I have built this website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, putting in practice what I have learned in class.

I found it very challenging to recreate the website with Bootstrap. Although it seemed fairly easy to copy and paste the snippets of code, I struggled on styling each section.

# Challenges

I had multiple challenges during this project. The CTRL + S became my favourite combination of buttons haha. I had to play around with the CSS in order to get the right solution. Below, I have listed a couple of issues that caused me some trouble:

1. My first issue was the navbar. I have styled it the way I wanted but I spent some time on the burger menu which wasn't displaying on responsive. I realised that Bootstrap has some additional classes which are applying some colours and fonts which cannot be overwritten unless I use !important, for example: 'navbar-light' which was adding a light background throughout the nav. I have removed a couple of classes and by mistake I have removed the burger menu as well. I then re-pasted the Navbar code from the Bootstrap website and looked at each line carefully so I don't do the same mistake. In the end I made the burger menu work.

2. Related to my first issue, was the burger menu recolouring. I couldn't get the 3 parallel lines to display so as a solution, I have downloaded the burger graphic from the Bootstrap website (downloaded using inspect) and added it in the CSS.

3. Another challenge which I still don't understand how this works was the column layout. I have made all the sections fluid, filling the entire screen but then I struggled on centering the content within the columns. In the end I made them work somehow.

# The Journey

1. I firstly started with the HTML code, mainly made from Bootstrap which took me a few minutes.<img width="1920" alt="First HTML Code" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115581300/200630366-947ebafd-59c2-43d8-999d-96a79b8c850c.png">

2. Secondly, I have started writing the CSS to customize the Bootstarp snippets.<img width="1920" alt="CSS Code" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115581300/200630388-d48de6de-9ce9-4f45-a8b1-b785b0c9d50e.png">
